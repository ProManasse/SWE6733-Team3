\***\*SECOND SPRINT\*\***

_Objectives:_

<hr>

- You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during this sprint. Your forecast is based on the Yesterday's Weather forecasting pattern. The forecast along with its rationale are documented in your git’s repo.

  - https://manassenk.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SKP/boards/2?selectedIssue=SKP-83

<hr>

- You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.

<hr>

- Your sprint backlog, including both stories and tasks, is represented in a kanban board. The kanban board, or a URL of the kanban board (from your online management tool), is documented in your git’s repo. I should be able to view the board.[Update your sprint backlog task board. Make sure the URL or images are available in your git’s repo].

<hr>

- You have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart (from your online management tool), is documented in your git’s repo. I should be able to view the burndown chart.

  <hr>

- You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You have evidence of at least one daily scrum documented in your git’s repo, should cover the following three items:

- What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members did which activities.

  - We met several times over the phone to go over what we will work on and how we were going to split the work being done. This included agreen on tasks being delivered, numbering tasks and going over any blockers that would prevent us from delivering the prouct

- What will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members plan to do which activities.
  - Mannesse will continue the development phase, I will look into creating an AWS account that will help us host the application and continue updating the README file.

<hr>

- Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?
  - Mostly time related, we have several items to complete in a small timeframe, this also includes my incapablity to work on much of the development. We want to deliver the most basic functional product and and eventually expand to add additional features.

<hr>

- There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your git’s repo.

<hr>

- There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There are at least 2 BDD / A-TDD test in your test suite (at least 1 new one this sprint), and it passes. There are at least 20 unit tests in your test suite (at least 10 new unit tests this sprint), and they all pass.

<hr>

- Your team conducts a Sprint Review. There should be an evidence to that.

Things that we did well: 
- We communicated well throughout the sprint process meeting three times and going over all material needed to complete the tasks.
- We organized tasks effectively as a group and distributed tasks accordingly. 
- Helped each other out when things became difficult.

Things that need improvement: 
- A bit of disconnect between development and organizational tasks.
- Meeting in different timezones and non-school tasks made it difficult more often. 
- Using multiple environments in order to complete tasks can be daunting and time consuming. 

Kudos:
- To Manasse for completing most development tasks
- To Manasse for setting Jira Tickets
- To Luciano for organizing README document

<hr>

- You have a Continuous Integration (CI) system running in your project. The CI system automatically builds your code every time you merge to master. The CI system executes your tests every time it builds the code. Your rationale for the CI tool used (i.e., why did you use this CI tool?) is clearly documented in your git repo, plus the evidence/link is included in your git’s repo.

  - Link to CICD

<hr>

- Optional: You have a Continuous Deployment system running. The CD system deploys your software to a production-like environment. The CD system executes additional tests of your software in the production-like environment. The CD system deploys your software to a live production environment. Your live production environment works properly. The evidence/link is included in your git’s repo.

<hr>

- Your product increment is working software—the completed stories in this sprint must be reflected in the application/product (in form of features) and ready to show to your customer. A link to your work-in-progress application should be documented in your git’s repo.
